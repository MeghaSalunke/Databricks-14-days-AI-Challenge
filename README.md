This repository captures my hands-on learning journey through the **Databricks 14 Days AI Challenge**, organized by **Indian Data Club × Codebasics** and sponsored by **Databricks**.  
The challenge focuses on building **scalable data engineering, analytics, and ML workflows** using the Databricks platform.

---

## 📌 Overview

Over 14 days, I worked on real-world inspired use cases covering the **full data lifecycle** — from raw data ingestion to analytics and machine learning.  
The learning was completely **hands-on**, with Databricks notebooks, SQL queries, and experiments executed on Delta Lake.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- Databricks
- Apache Spark (PySpark)
- Delta Lake
- Databricks SQL & Dashboards
- MLflow
- scikit-learn
- SQL

## 📘 What I Learned

- Designing **end-to-end data pipelines** using the Medallion Architecture (Bronze, Silver, Gold)
- Handling incremental data with **MERGE**, Time Travel, and Delta optimizations
- Performance tuning using **partitioning, OPTIMIZE, Z-ORDER, and caching**
- Data governance with **Unity Catalog**, access control, and lineage
- Building analytical queries, funnels, and dashboards
- Feature engineering and basic statistical analysis
- Tracking and versioning ML experiments using **MLflow**

---

## 🧪 Hands-on Experience

- Built production-style pipelines using Databricks notebooks and Jobs
- Orchestrated multi-task workflows with dependencies
- Optimized large Delta tables for faster analytics
- Created ML-ready datasets and tracked models with MLflow
- Validated results using execution plans, metrics, and dashboards
